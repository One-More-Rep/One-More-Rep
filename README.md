# One-More-Rep

## Synopsis
One More Rep is a fitness app that generates a custom workout tailored to your athletic ability. It will tell you exactly how much weight you're supposed to lift, the rep count, the set count and the rest time.

## Motivation
We came up with this idea because we wanted to help everyone from gym newcomers to athletes. Studies have shown that the two main reason why a new gym member quits after a couple weeks is because they are overwhelmed with the lack of knowledge and feel defeated, due to lack of result. This app aims to fix that problem by taking the guess work out of the equation and letting users track their weekly progress through a chart.
As far as the athletes go, nothing is more crucial than getting the most accurate estimate on what you are supposed to be doing in the gym. Every rep and every breath you take between those sets are crucial to your success, and this app will be the tool that will get you there.
