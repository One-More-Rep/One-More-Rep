# One-More-Rep

## Synopsis
One More Rep is a fitness app that generates a custom workout tailored to your athletic ability. It will tell you exactly how much weight you're supposed to lift, the rep count, the set count, and the rest time. 

## Motivation
We came up with this idea because we wanted to help everyone from gym newcomers to athletes. Studies have shown that the two main reason why a new gym member quits after a couple weeks is because they are overwhelmed with the lack of knowledge, and defeated due to lack of result. This demographic will benefit from this app by knocking two birds with one stone by taking the guessing work out of the equation and a progress map showing how those extra 10 pounds you added to your bench this week. 
As far as the athletes go, nothing is more crucial than getting the most accurate estimate on what you are supposed to be doing in the gym. Every rep, every breath you take between those sets, they are crucial to your success and this app will be the tool that will get you there.
